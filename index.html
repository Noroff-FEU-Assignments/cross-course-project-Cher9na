        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my first website</p>
        <h2>Web security</h2>
        <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure
            his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your
            answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
        <p id="web-security-answer">Before giving advice to my client about web security I would ask for permission to have a look at the website,
            and see if their data and information are secured in an accepted system in the right format. 
            Then ask them if there are aware of the threats in web security. </p>
        <p id="web-security-answer">If the data is not secured in an accepted system in the right format I would recommend that first, 
            set up a cyber security framework detailing the risks and activities that may occur and of course build a security software from that. 
            It is very important to involve all the developers who are working on the website to be aware of their responsibility for the security of their applications.
            Another well-known way to secure the website is to ensure an authorization and authentication, so it is hard to crack. </p>
        <p id="web-security-answer">Also Run a security check though CI/CD on every integrated and delivered code to production. 
            Finally, it is important to check that sensitive information is safe, and from time to time to run a test like fake attack.</p>
